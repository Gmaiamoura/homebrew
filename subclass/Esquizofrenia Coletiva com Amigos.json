				"The god that you worship is bizarre, and forgotten to almost all in the realms of men. Gods of Slime are often nameless, churning deities of filth, possessing no temples and few if any worshippers. It is, therefore, a mystery wherefore their immense power originates. Scholars of divinity speculate that, perhaps, the Mind Domain naturally occurs as a result of other gods' waste. Or perhaps, oozes themselves, in spite of being unintelligent in every conceivable sense, still possess the capability to worship at some level, and therefore empower these nameless gods.",
